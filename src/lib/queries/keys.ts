/**
 * Query key factories for TanStack React Query.
 *
 * Convention : chaque domaine expose un objet `xxxKeys` avec :
 * - `all` : racine pour invalidation large
 * - `lists()` / `list(filters)` : pour les listings
 * - `detail(id)` : pour les ressources individuelles
 *
 * Pour invalider toutes les queries d'un domaine après mutation :
 * `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: xxxKeys.all })`
